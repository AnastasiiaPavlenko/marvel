Hi and welcome to the Marvel world.

My name is Anastasiia Pavlenko and this is a Marvel characters records project, where you can learn more about Marvel characters.

This project was created using React and Redux and some third-party libraries like material-table.

To run the app on your machine install node modules with 'npm install' and then run it locally with 'npm run start'.

Hope you have fun.
